Make a shortcut to the Realterm executable and put in on your desktop
Right click that shortcut, select properties
In the Realterm shortcut properties "target" dialog box, you want text similar to this: 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\BEL\Realterm\realterm.exe" scanports=0 baud=9600 port=67 rows=60
The above line needs quotes where they are shown. 
The first part of this line, the part in quotes will already exist in your shortcut. You just need to add the rest, including a separating space.
Note: the port setting may be different for each Teensy module (it's a Windows thing), but once Windows picks a port for a given Teensy it will stay the same.
Your port will likely be a much lower number. On my PC it is actually that high and it means that since this PC started operation, 67 such devices have been connected to it!
You can find the port number for any Teensy which is connected at that moment in Device Manager -> Ports. A a screen capture is provided.
